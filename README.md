## Steam icons downloader

First run install_deps that will install the required dependecies locally in the script directory
Then you can change the paths of the icon theme and the resolution of the icons inside main.py
By default the script will use /tmp and the GNOME default icon theme 'hicolor'

### This script is meant to be used on Linux, maybe someday I'll make it work on Windows too
